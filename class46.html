      <h3><li>Playing games is like yoga for your mind (may be perfect for the inflexible part of population). 
            Every time you let go, you play really well.
            Wanting and over-stressing makes you a bad gamer. Apply that learning from games anywhere else and youâ€™ll see.<br><br>
        </li>

      <li>Playing games bring people together, it is the competition among peers that adds adrenaline.
        After a success in a game, we are more likely to set an ambitious goal for ourselves,
        even outside of gaming. Basically, games can turn your superpowers on. Try it yourself!<br><br></li>
       <li>
        Games are critically important in establishing healthy social interactions, and failing to play them can result in 
        inappropriate aggression, anxiety and social isolation. 
        Because of this role for playing in social learning, the most important games may be the ones we play when we are young.<br>
